[WEBSITE](https://leek-wars-restator.vercel.app/)

This project was inspired from the original [restator](http://leekwars.restator.free.fr/) project

It is a tool to theorycraft builds & player stats for the coding game [LeekWars](https://leekwars.com/)

The original project was outdated (LeekWars now has chips, RAM, Cores etc) so I decided to make my own

It is still a work in progress

# Roadmap

- Add weapon & chips ✅
